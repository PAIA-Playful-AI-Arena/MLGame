# Change Log

The format is modified from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

### [Beta 8.0.1] - 2020.10.05

**Changed**

* The recorded game progress for the inactivated ml client will be an empty list.

### [Beta 8.0] - 2020.09.29

**Added**

* Add `"record_format_version"` field to the log file

**Changed**

* Change the data structure received from or sent to the game class: use a dict to store the information of each ml client. For example, the game has two players and defines the name of them as `"ml_1P"` and `"ml_2P"` in the `config.py`.
  * The scene information returned from `get_player_scene_info()` will be:
    ```
    {
        "ml_1P": scene_info_for_ml_1P,
        "ml_2P": scene_info_for_ml_2P
    }
    ```
  * The command sent to the `update()` will be:
    ```
    {
        "ml_1P": command_sent_from_ml_1P,
        "ml_2P": command_sent_from_ml_2P
    }
    ```
  * And the command returned from `get_keyboard_command()` should also be:
    ```
    {
        "ml_1P": command_for_ml_1P,
        "ml_2P": command_for_ml_2P
    }
    ```
* Record the scene information and command individually for each ml client in the log file
* Update the version of built-in games
  * arkanoid: 1.0 -> 1.1
  * pingpong: 1.1 -> 1.2
  * snake: 1.0 -> 1.1

### [Beta 7.2] - 2020.08.23

**Fixed**

* The game could not be closed when running non-python client

**Changed**

* `-i/--input-script` supports specifying the file in the subdirectory
  * For example, `-i foo/ml_play.py` means the file is at `games/<game_name>/ml/foo/ml_play.py`

**Removed**

* Remove `--input-module` flag

### [Beta 7.1.3] - 2020.06.20

**Fixed**

* Handle the exception of `SystemExit`
* Handle the situation of reseting the ml executor before the game ends
  * The game executor will ignore the ready command.

**Changed**

* Optimize the checking of the received object from either side

### [Beta 7.1.2] - 2020.06.19

**Fixed**

* Use wrong value to chack frame delay

**Changed**

* Modify the game "snake" for the game development tutorial
  * The `ml_play_template.py` of the game "snake" contains simple rule-based algorithm.

### [Beta 7.1.1] - 2020.06.15

**Changed**

* ML process doesn't send the command only when the returned value of `MLPlay.update()` is `None`.

### [Beta 7.1] - 2020.06.01

**Fixed**

* Handle the exception of `BrokenPipeError`

**Added**

* Add "dynamic_ml_clients" to the "GAME_SETUP" of the game config

### [Beta 7.0.1] - 2020.05.29

This update is compatible with Beta 7.0.

**Fixed**

* Hang when the game exits on Linux

**Added**

* Add `errno.py` to define the exit code of errors
* Handle the exception occurred in manual mode

**Changed**

* Change the exit code of errors

### [Beta 7.0] - 2020.05.27

**Added**

* Use executors to control the execution loop
  * The game and the ml script only need to provide "class" for the executor to invoke (like an interface).
  * The game doesn't need to provide manual and ml version. Just one game class.
  * Replace `ml_loop()` with `MLPlay` class in ml script
* Add commnuication manager
  * The manager for the ml process has a queue for storing the object received. If the queue has more than 15 objects, the oldest object will be dropped.

**Changed**

* Change the format of the recording game progress
* Replace `PROCESSES` with `GAME_SETUP` in `config.py` of the game to setup the game and the ml scripts
* Rename `GameConfig` to `ExecutionCommand`
* Simplfy the `communication` package into a module

**Removed**

* Remove `record.py` and ml version of the game in the game directory

### [Beta 6.1] - 2020.05.06

**Changed**

* Pingpong - version 1.1
  * Shorten the ball speed increasing interval
  * Randomly set the initial position of the blocker, and speed up the moving speed of it

### [Beta 6.0] - 2020.04.28

**Added**

* Add `-l` and `--list` flag for listing available games
* Use `config.py` in games to set up the game parameters and the game execution
* Use `argparse` for generating and handling game parameters
  * List game parameters of a game by using `python MLGame.py <game> -h`
* Exit with non-zero value when an error occurred

**Changed**

* The game execution flags must be specified before the game name, including `-i/--input-script/--input-module` flags
* `-i/--input-script/--input-module` flags carry one script or one module at a time.
  * Specify these flags multiple times for multiple scripts or modules, such as `-i script_1P -i script_2P`.
* Games: Use dictionary objects as communication objects between game and ml processes for flexibility
  * The record file only contains dictionay objects and built-in types, therefore, it can be read outside the `mlgame` directory.
* `mlgame.gamedev.recorder.RecorderHelper` only accepts dictionary object.
* Code refactoring

**Removed**

* Games
  * Remove `main.py` (replaced by `config.py`)
  * Remove `communication.py`
    * For the ml script, use `mlgame.communication.ml` module to communicate with the game process. See `ml_play_template.py` for the example.
* Remove `CommandReceiver` from the `mlgame.communication.game`
  * The game has to validate the command recevied by itself.
