Control the snake, eat as much food as possible.

## Execution

* Manual mode: `python MLGame.py -m snake`
    * Controlling: arrow keys
    * Perhaps 30 fps is too fast to play.
* ML mode: `python MLGame.py -i ml_play_template.py snake`

## Detailed Game Information

### Game Coordinate

The same as the game "Arkanoid"

### Game area

300 \* 300 pixels

### Game objects

#### Snake

* The snake is composed of squares. The size of a square is 10 \* 10 pixels.
* The head is a green square, the bodies are white squares.
* The head is initially at (40, 40), and the bodies are at (40, 30), (40, 20), (40, 10).
* The snake initially goes downward. It moves 10 pixels long per frame.
* The snake body will increase one when it eats the food.

#### Food

* The food is 10-by-10-pixel square, but its appearance is a red circle.
* The position of the food is randomly decided, which is (0 <= 10 \* m < 300, 0 <= 10 \* n < 300), where m and n are non-negative integers.

## Communicate with Game

View the example of the ml script in [`ml/ml_play_template.py`](ml/ml_play_template.py).

### Communication Objects

#### Scene Information

A dictionary object sent from the game process, and also an object to be pickled in the record file.

```
{
    'frame': 12,
    'status': 'GAME_ALIVE',
    'snake_head': (160, 40),
    'snake_body': [(150, 40), (140, 40), (130, 40)],
    'food': (100, 60)
}
```

The keys and values of the scene information:

* `"frame"`: An integer. The number of the frame that this scene information is for.
* `"status"`: A string. The game status at this frame. It's one of the following value:
    * `"GAME_ALIVE"`: The snake is still going.
    * `"GAME_OVER"`: The snake hits the wall or itself.
* `"snake_head"`: An `(x, y)` tuple. The position of the snake head.
* `"snake_body"`: A list storing the position of snake bodies, and the storing order is from the head to the tail. Each element in the list is an `(x, y)` tuple.
* `"food"`: An `(x, y)` tuple. The position of the food.

#### Game Command

A string command sent to the game process for controlling the moving direction of the snake.

```
'RIGHT'
```

Here are the available commands:

* `"UP"`: Make the snake move upward.
* `"DOWN"`: Make the snake move downward.
* `"LEFT"`: Make the snake move to left.
* `"RIGHT"`: Make the snake move to right.
* `"NONE"`: Do not change the moving direction of snake.

### Log File

The name of the ml client in the log flie is `"ml"`.
