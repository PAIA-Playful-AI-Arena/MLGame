# PingPong

## Overview

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ke6nUrB.gif" height="500px" />

At the beginning of a round, you could move the platform to decide where to serve the ball and its direction. If the ball is not served in 150 frames, it will be randomly served from the platform. The ball speed starts from 7, and is increased every 200 frames. If the ball speed exceeds 40, this round is a draw game.

There are two mechanisms. One is ball slicing: The x speed of the ball will be changed according to the movement of the platform while the platform catches the ball. The other is a moving blocker at the middle of the game place.

## Execution

* Manual mode: `python MLGame.py -m pingpong <difficulty> [game_over_score]`
    * Serve the ball to the left/right: 1P - `.`, `/`; 2P - `Q`, `E`
    * Move the platform: 1P - `left`, `right` arrow keys; 2P - `A`, `D`
* ML mode: `python MLGame.py -i ml_play_template.py pingpong <difficulty> [game_over_score]`

### Game Parameters

* `difficulty`: The game style. There are 3 difficulties.
    * `EASY`: The simple pingpong game.
    * `NORMAL`: The ball slicing mechanism is added.
    * `HARD`: The ball slicing and the blocker mechanism are added.
* `game_over_score`: [Optional] When the score of either side reaches this value, the game will be exited. The default value is 3. If the `-1` flag is set, it will be 1.

## Detailed Game Information

### Game Coordinate

Same as the game "Arkanoid"

### Game Area

500 \* 200 pixels

1P side is at the lower half of the game area, and 2P side is at the upper half of the game area.

### Game Objects

#### Ball

* The ball is a 5-by-5-pixel green square.
* The ball will be served from the 1P side first, and then change side for each round.
* The ball is served from the platform, and it can be served to the left or right. If the ball is not served in 150 frames, it will be automatically served to the random direction.
* The initial moving speed is (&plusmn;7, &plusmn;7) pixels per frame, and it is increased every 200 frames after the ball is served.

#### Platform

* The platform is a 40-by-30-pixel rectangle.
* The color of the 1P platform is red, and it of the 2P platform is blue.
* The moving speed is (&plusmn;5, 0) pixels per frame.
* The initial position of the 1P platform is at (80, 420), and it of the 2P platform is at (80, 50).

#### Ball Slicing Mechanism

The x speed of the ball is changed according to the movement of the platform while it catches the ball.

* If the platform moves in the same direction of the ball, the x speed of the ball is increased by 3 (only once).
* If the platform is stable, the x speed of the ball is reset to current basic ball speed.
* If the platform moves in the opposite direction of the ball, the ball will be hit back to the direction where it comes from and the x speed is reset to the current basic ball speed.

The ball slicing mechanism is added on `NORMAL` and `HARD` difficulties.

#### Blocker

* The blocker is a 30-by-20-pixel rectangle.
* The initial position is at (85, 240). The moving speed is (&plusmn;3, 0) pixels per frame.
* The blocker will keep moving left and right. The initial direction is random.
* The blocker doesn't have ball slicing mechanism, which the ball speed is the same after it hits the blocker.

The blocker is added on `HARD` difficulty.

## Communicate with Game

View the example of the ml script in [`ml/ml_play_template.py`](ml/ml_play_template.py).

### `ml_loop()`

The `ml_loop()` function must has a `side` parameter. The game will pass `"1P"` or `"2P"` to it to distinguish which side the script is used by. You can write codes for both sides in the same script. For example:

```python
def ml_loop(side):
    if side == "1P":
        ml_loop_for_1P()
    else:   # "2P"
        ml_loop_for_2P()
```

### Methods

Use `mlgame.communication.ml` module to communicate with game process:

* `ml_ready()`: Inform the game process that ml process is ready
* `recv_from_game()`: Receive a dictionary object storing the scene information from the game process
* `send_to_game(dict)`: Send a dictionary object storing the game command to the game process

### Communication Objects

The dictionary object are used as communication object transporting between game and ml processes.

#### Scene Information

It is an dictionary object sent from the game process, and also an object to be pickled in the record file.

The keys and values of the scene information:

* `"frame"`: An integer. The number of frame that this scene information is for
* `"status"`: A string. The game status at this frame. It's one of the following 4 statuses:
    * `"GAME_ALIVE"`: This round is still going.
    * `"GAME_1P_WIN"`: 1P wins this round.
    * `"GAME_2P_WIN"`: 2P wins this round.
    * `"GAME_DRAW"`: This round is a draw game.
* `"ball"`: An `(x, y)` tuple. The position of the ball.
* `"ball_speed"`: An `(x, y)` tuple. The speed of the ball.
* `"platform_1P"`: An `(x, y)` tuple. The position of the 1P platform.
* `"platform_2P"`: An `(x, y)` tuple. The position of the 2P platform.
* `"blocker"`: An `(x, y)` tuple. The position of the blocker. If the game is not on `HARD` difficulty, this field is `None`.
* `"command_1P"`: A string. The command 1P decided according to this frame. Only included in the record file.
* `"command_2P"`: A string. The command 2P decided according to this frame. Only included in the record file.

#### Game Command

It is an dictionary object sent to the game process for controlling the platform.

The keys and values of the game command:

* `"frame"`: An integer. The number of frame that this game command is for. It should be the same as the frame of the scene information received.
* `"command"`: A string. It's one of the following commands:
    * `"SERVE_TO_LEFT"`: Serve the ball to the left.
    * `"SERVE_TO_RIGHT"`: Serve the ball to the right.
    * `"MOVE_LEFT"`: Move the platform to the left.
    * `"MOVE_RIGHT"`: Move the platform to the right.
    * `"NONE"`: Do nothing.

## Input Scripts for ML Mode

The pingpong game is a 2P game, so it can accept two different ml scripts by specifying `-i <script_for_1P> -i <script_for_2P>`. If there is only one script specified, 1P and 2P will use the same script.

You can specify `ml_play_manual.py` as the input script. It will create an invisible joystick for you to play with the ml process. For example:
1. Start the game by the command `python MLGame.py -i ml_play_template.py -i ml_play_manual.py pingpong <difficulty>`. There will be 2 windows, and one is the "Invisible joystick". The terminal will output a message "Invisible joystick is used. Press Enter to start the 2P ml process."

2. Drag the invisible joystick aside, and focus on it (The color of the window title is not gray).

3. Press Enter key to start the game, and use left and right arrow keys to control the platform of the selected side.

## About the Ball

The behavior of the ball is the same as the game "Arkanoid".
